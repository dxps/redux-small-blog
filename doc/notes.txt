Actions for implementing post creation feature:

1. Scaffold out the component to show the post creation form.

2. Add the component to the routes.

3. Implement an 'Add Post' button to the index.

4. Add the form to the post creation component.
   Submitting the form will call an action creator.

5. Create the action creator and update the reducer.
